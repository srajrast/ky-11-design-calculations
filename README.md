# KY-11 Design Calculations
This is a list of all of the MATLAB scripts used to perform calculations when designing the KY-11 WarGator

### Preliminary Sizing
**WeightEstimation.m**: Initial calculations of the maximum takeoff weight for propeller vs. jet engines and design vs. ferry mission
**Wing_Loading.m**: Initial calculations of wing loading at three conditions
**Thrust2weight.m**: Initial calculations of T/W at three mission segments

### Aerodynamics
**LiftCoeffEstimation.m**: Lift coefficient calculations used for wing design
